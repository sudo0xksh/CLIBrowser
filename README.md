# CLIBrowser
A brutally simple CLI-based browser that fetches websites using Python, prints the HTTP status code like a proud hacker, and dumps raw HTML straight into your terminal like it owns the place.  No GUI. No mercy. Just requests and vibes.  Built for people who think browsers are overrated and terminals are underrated.
